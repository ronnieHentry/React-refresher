# React-refresher

Learning react core concepts from scratch

# Basics:

React can be included in a project by simply including it's CDN link into the script tag along with the react DOM library.
Then use React.createElement method to create a JS object describing the elements needed to be rendered. This function takes in 3 arguments: 1. The HTML element type 2. The HTML attributes as an object 3. Children
This create element function will return an object containing the type of element, and its children or attributes in the "props" property.
This object is then fed into the react DOM library and finally rendered in the real DOM by replacing the contents inside the dom id provided.

Create a package.json file using npm init
Install parcel package as a dev dependency.
Parcel is a web application bundler â€“ a tool that simplifies the process of building and bundling front-end assets like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other files. It is designed to be zero-config, meaning you can start using it without any complex setup or configuration files, making it beginner-friendly and efficient for quick development.
Install react and react dom packages and import it to your JS file. Mention type = "module" in script tag.
run "npx parcel index.html" to create a development build and host it to localhost

# Episode 3

The command to start an application can be found in the "scrips" in package.json. So when you type "npm run start" in console, it'll execute the "start" script fron package.json.
In npm, when you use npm start, it's a special built-in shorthand for npm run start. The start script is a predefined script in npm, and you can run it without explicitly using run.
So, both npm start and npm run start would achieve the same result of running the "start" script defined in your package.json. It's just a convenient shorthand provided by npm to make common commands more concise.
npm start === npm run start ---- starts a development build
npm build ----- creates a production ready (optimized) build

JSX : used to create react element objects by using html like syntax. If you console.log jsx elements in the browser, it'll be an object in the exact format that React.createElement returns
JSX is NOT a part of React package but works hand in hand with react. The JSX code is transpiled (converted to code browsers can understand) by the parcel library using babel before passing it into the browser
JSX is converted into React.createElement code by babel which is then converted to HTML code

Functional components: Functional components are just javascript functions that return React.createElement or JSX. The name of a functional component needs start with uppercase characters for babel to understand it's a component. The functional component can be displayed in DOM by calling it inside the root.render(functionalComponent()) or using jsx root.render(<FunctionalComponent />)
A functional component can be rendered using jsx or invoking it like a regular function like the above example.
JSX will prevent cross site scripting and prevents malicious attacks.
